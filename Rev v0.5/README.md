Calvin is ridiculous and doesn't use SolidWorks.
Here are some STEP files.  Get in touch if that's a problem.

THOUGHTS 11/05
- Need to double-check the insertion level on 20 and 40 pin connectors
- Rear solar 20-pin males need room for their feet
- Do we actually need gussets / endcaps?
- Do we need this many bolts on the back?

THOUGHTS 10/30
- Top/bottom cards won't be able to slide in and out because solar panel connectors

TODO
- 3D printed mockup by November 15th
- Put vertical connector on endcap solar panel

- Integrate reaction wheels
