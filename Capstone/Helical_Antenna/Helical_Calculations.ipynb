    "Let's incorporate a factor of safety (is that necessary at this point?) and look at the bending stresses caused by winding the spring into a spiral (see *Wound Stowage* in the Helical Design notebook).  If those stresses seem reasonable then we will need to adjust the deflection to calculate the stresses of a flat-packed spring. \n",
    "\n",
    "See Shigley, Chapter 3.8 for details on the shear modulus of elasticity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Do we need to worry about residual stresses?  \"Winding of the spring induces residual stresses through bending, but these are normal to the direction of the torsional working stresses in a coil spring.  Quite frequently in spring manufacture, they are relieved, after winding, by a mild thermal treatment.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "How about stress relaxation?  Shiva is going to consult some faculty and look into this...\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Set Removal\n",
    "We'll want to design the spring to be nominally longer than desired so that it will rebound to its desired length after being fully compressed.  \"If the stress at the solid height is greater than 1.3 times the torsional yield strength, distortion may occur.  If this stress is much less than 1.1 times, it is difficult to control the resulting free length.\"\n",

    "Is this going to be an issue with tethers supporting each coil?  Let's do some static analysis and look into it...\n",

    "Once all of this is done we can start calculating the manufacturing parameters.  If we're going to be prototyping our own springs on a lathe (see *Lathe* in the Helical Design notebook) then we'll need to know a few things, like the mandrel diameter (since it will relax to a wider diameter).  \n",
